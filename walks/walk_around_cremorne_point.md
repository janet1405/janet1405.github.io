## Walk around Cremorne Point

I have done this walk sporadically for more than 50 years and have never got tired of it!! It is one of the most beautiful walks in all of Sydney. I just wish I had done it more often!!


We will take the 236 bus, leaving 9:00am from around Mosman High School, going to Mosman Wharf to meet the 9:20am ferry. We get off at Cremorne Point and take the 225 bus getting off at near Iredale Avenue, the so called Iredale stop. 


Walk a few meters to the right to walk down Murdoch Street, then Bogota Ave, or go a few meters to the left to go down about 25 steps on the left. The walk down Bogota Ave is a little steep but very doable. Look for the path to the left at the bottom. 


The next part is a very beautiful, level walk with grand views of the Harbour and the city, and it takes less than 20 minutes. It is just over 1 kilometre long. 


Time for a coffee at the Wharf and a toilet stop on the higher part.  When we are ready to go again, if you don’t like steps, you should walk back a little and from there you can walk on the level to the beautiful parklands at Cremorne Point, with views across the Harbour and back towards Mosman. Often you will find artists sketching the very beautiful landscapes and more distant harbour views.


We will take a little time here to enjoy wandering towards the lighthouse and having a look. Remember romantic memories of late night dreamy visits, when it was not locked off and you could just sit and dream under the stars. After that, we will continue our walk along the east side of Cremorne Point, a great walk!


There are three major features: the history of coal mining, the architectural style of some of the ”grand” houses, and the gardens, created out of nothing by a devoted elderly couple and now maintained by volunteers.


After the Old Cremorne Wharf, we will continue on the track which rises a bit, then goes through Bromley Street and through Hartnett Park, with very nice natural vegetation and wonderful views back to the Harbour. If you want to take it a little easy at this stage, you have the option of catching the ferry at the Old Cremorne Wharf at 13 minutes past each hour. 


If you are joining us for lunch, you can either wait for the main group at Mosman Bay Wharf, or take the next bus and meet us at the lovely new restaurant, the Hawthorn, on the corner on Gouldsbury Street and Military Road.


Hawthorn Mosman is a new casual restaurant and wine bar, owned and operated by Sean Byrne, who was general manager of Jonah’s Whale Beach for ten years before deciding it was time to set up shop in his own neighbourhood here at Mosman.
